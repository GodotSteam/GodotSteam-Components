# GodotSteam Components
Quick and handy pre-built components for rapidly building with GodotSteam. The project is currently in the planning stages so this readme will change a lot in the coming months.

Initial Plans
---
Naturally, we will start with community feedback and proposals as we start ironing out the plan. After some weeks, we will moving into building out the process of making these things then finally into doing so.

Some of the main areas of functionality that is being considered:
- Lobby system (join, leave, host, chat)
- Networking / P2P systems (Networking, Messages, Sockets)
- Achievements / Statistics
- Inputs
- Leaderboards
- Workshop / UGC
- Game Uploader / VDF Editor

Once we begin building, the code will be available in this repo with different branches for each tool; not the best organization of such a project but they should be somewhat separated so people can use the ones they want without having to integrate them all.
